Splitting videos into three folders due to limited storage capacity: Video1: 0-200; Video2: 201-350; Video3: 351-rest


Run the following for each folder to generate result ‘test_{}.json’, and delete the intermediate result which is in the new folder 'img' in each folder:

-Change path in each file

-Run final_batch_processsing.sh which runs the following:
1. mp4tolist.py # convert video into images and list txt file
2. batch_demo.py # generate ML result
3. whole_processing.py # generate vehicle masks
4. lane_fit.py # calculate line regression result based on ML result
5. only_mask_obj.py # use mask of objection and hough line method to get a pure CV result
6. final_lines_generator.py # generate final lane detection results based on the previous ML and CV results
7. solid_dot_lane.py # assign line_style label to the final results
8. line_crossing_detection.py # line crossing detection and output final json
